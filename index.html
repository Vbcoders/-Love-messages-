      "My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you - my Life seems to stop without you - I see no further. You have absorb'd me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving - I should be miserable position with the hope of soon seeing you.<br>
     Falling in love with you was the best thing that happened to me. Your love helped me grow as a person, and I will always be grateful for it.<br>
     A lot of things change with time, including feelings for people. Even though you hold a special place in my heart, our relationship has come to the point where I don’t feel that we connect like before."<br>
